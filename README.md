#  Deploying Website with the help AWS 

This project demonstrates that  how a CI/CD pipeline is implemented to automate website deployment using Jenkins, Docker, and Git (GitHub for version control) on Ubuntu servers. Whenever new code is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically retrieves the changes, builds a Docker image, and redeploys the website. This process ensures continuous integration and continuous delivery, keeping the website consistently updated and reducing manual effort.

##  Project Overview

This project showcases the implementation of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for seamless website 
deployment using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub on an Ubuntu-based server environment. 
Whenever developers push new code to the GitHub repository, Jenkins is triggered via webhook, which 
initiates the pipeline. Jenkins pulls the latest changes, builds a new Docker image of the application, and 
redeploys the container — replacing the old version of the website with the updated one. 
This automated workflow ensures: 
Continuous Integration – every code change is automatically tested and integrated. 
Continuous Delivery – the website is always in a deployable state. 
Reduced Manual Intervention – deployment becomes faster, consistent, and error-free. 
By combining Docker for containerization and Jenkins for pipeline automation, the system guarantees a 
reliable and scalable approach to modern web deployment.
